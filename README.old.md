## Overview
Subtraktor is a minimalist, function‑first subtractive synthesizer built in 
idiomatic F#. It’s designed as a learning project and a craft project in equal 
measure: a place where clear concepts, composable functions, and thoughtful 
engineering come together to form a small but expressive sound engine.

### Envelopes
For the user, an envelope is just a `Signal`. It can be applied to any other signal
in order to control its amplitude.
